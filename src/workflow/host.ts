/**
 * host.ts — binds a workflow run to the pi-herdr spawn machinery.
 *
 * This file is OURS (v0.6 issue 12, ~the "host seam" half of the workflow
 * ticket): `runtime.ts` deliberately knows nothing about herdr — its only seam
 * is the injected {@link WorkflowHost}, which is what keeps the runtime's tests
 * free of panes, settings and sessions. Everything the script can reach through
 * `agent()`, `resume` and `gate` ends up here.
 *
 * The mappings (issue 12's option table):
 *
 *   - **handles.** The runtime hands out `wf-agent-N` ids for its progress
 *     entries; the spawn engine issues the pane handle. `handles` translates,
 *     for the whole run — `resume` reaches back to a child that has already
 *     finished, and `abortAgent` runs after the handle exists.
 *   - **type/kind.** `agentType` resolves through the `.md` registry (the same
 *     dispatch herdr_spawn_agent uses, `general-purpose` by default); the KIND
 *     is pinned to `pi` — the v0.6 ruling: workflow children ride the session
 *     substrate (JSONL result, sidecar, resume), which is pi-only.
 *   - **model/effort.** `model` and `effort` (→ `thinking`) ride the spawn
 *     engine's routing chain at level 1 — exact authenticated `provider/model-id`
 *     or the spawn refuses, naming the level. A refusal is THIS agent's failure
 *     (the script sees null), not the run's — upstream's ruling.
 *   - **isolation.** `isolation: "worktree"` → the engine's `isolated` (herdr-side
 *     auto worktree). A gate then runs against the worktree the child wrote.
 *   - **completion.** The 06 push machinery IS the completion callback: the host
 *     awaits `getAgentResult` — the same sidecar → JSONL → gone detection the
 *     push loop reads. A BLOCKED child keeps the call waiting (decided): the
 *     delivery loop's blocked wake lands, and an answer via herdr_message_agent
 *     resumes the child.
 *   - **children report to the run, not the session.** Each spawned record is
 *     stamped with the run id; the delivery loop suppresses per-child terminal
 *     pushes for stamped records. The run itself pushes once, aggregated.
